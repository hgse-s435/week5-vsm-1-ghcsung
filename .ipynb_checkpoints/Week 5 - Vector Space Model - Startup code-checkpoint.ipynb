attentionaware      introduction despite our best efforts to write a clear and engaging paper  chances are high that within the next   pages you might fall prey to what is referred to as zoning out  daydreaming  or mind wandering      despite your best intention to concentrate on our paper  at some point your attention might drift away to unrelated thoughts of lunch  childcare  or an upcoming trip  this prediction is not based on some negative or cynical opinion of the reader reviewer  we read and review papers too   but on what is known about attentional control  vigilance  and concentration while individuals are engaged in complex comprehension activities  such as reading for understanding  one recent study tracked mind wandering of     individuals from   countries with a smartphone app that prompted people with thought probes at random intervals throughout the day      people reported mind wandering for      of the prompts  which confirmed lab studies on the pervasiveness of mind wandering  see     for a review   mind wandering is more than merely incidental  a recent meta analysis of   samples indicated a negative correlation between mind wandering and performance across a variety of tasks      a correlation which increases with task complexity  when compounded with its high frequency  mind wandering can have serious consequences on the performance and productivity of society at large   of learning with technology  traditional learning technologies rely on the assumption that students are attending to the learning session  although this is not always the case  for example  it has been estimated that students mind wander approximately    of the time when engaging with online lectures      which are an important component of moocs  some advanced technologies do aim to detect and respond to affective states like boredom  but evidence for their effectiveness is still equivocal  see     for a review   further  boredom is related to but not the same as attention      there are technologies that aim to prevent mind wandering by engendering a highly immersive learning experience and have achieved some success in this regard         but what is to be done when attentional focus inevitably wanes as the session progresses and the novelty of the system and content fades  our central thesis is that next generation learning technologies should include mechanisms to model and respond to learners  attention in real time      such attention aware technologies can model various aspects of learner attention  e g   divided attention  alternating attention   here  we focus on detecting and mitigating mind wandering  a quintessential signal of waning engagement  we situate our work in the context of reading because reading is a common activity shared across multiple learning technologies  thereby increasing the generalizability of our results  further  students mind wander approximately    of the time during computerized reading      and although mind wandering can facilitate certain cognitive processes like future planning and divergent thinking         it negatively correlates with comprehension and learning  reviewed in          suggesting that it is important to address mind wandering during learning  towards this end  we developed and validated a closed loop attention aware learning technology that combines a machinelearned mind wandering detector with a real time interpolated testing and re study intervention  our attention aware technology works as follows  learners read a text on a computer screen using a self paced screen by screen  also called page by page  reading paradigm  we track eye gaze during reading using a remote eye tracker that does not restrict head movements  we focus on eyegaze for mind wandering detection due to decades of research suggesting a tight coupling between attentional focus and eye movements during reading      when mind wandering is detected  the system intervenes in an attempt to redirect attentional focus and correct any comprehension deficits that might arise due to mind wandering  the interventions consist of asking comprehension question on pages where mind wandering was detected and providing opportunities to re read based on learners  responses  in this paper  we discuss the mind wandering  mind wandering is also unfortunately an under addressed problem in education and is yet to be deeply studied in the context   \f",
      "detector  intervention approach  and results of a summative evaluation study         related work the idea of attention aware user interfaces is not new  but was proposed almost a decade ago by roda and thomas      there was even an article on futuristic applications of attention aware systems in educational contexts      prior to this  gluck  et al      discussed the use of eye tracking to increase the bandwidth of information available to an intelligent tutoring system  its   similarly  anderson     followed up on some of these ideas by demonstrating how particular beneficial instructional strategies could only be launched via a real time analysis of eye gaze  most of the recent work has been on leveraging eye gaze to increase the bandwidth of learner models            conati  et al      provide an excellent review of much of the existing work in this area  we can group the research into three categories      offline analyses of eye gaze to study attentional processes      computational modeling of attentional states  and     closed loop systems that respond to attention in real time  offline analysis of eye movements has received considerable attention in cognitive and educational psychology for several decades  e g          so this area of research is relatively healthy  online computational models of learner attention are just beginning to emerge  e g          while closed loop attention aware systems are few and far between  see              for a more or less exhaustive list   two known examples  gazetutor and attentivereview  are discussed below  gazetutor     is a learning technology for biology  it has an animated conversational agent that provides spoken explanations on biology topics which are synchronized with images  the system uses a tobii t  eye tracker to detect inattention  which is assumed to occur when learners  gaze is not on the tutor agent or image for at least five consecutive seconds  when this occurs  the system interrupts its speech mid utterance  directs learners to reorient their attention  e g    i m over here you know    and repeats speaking from the start of the current utterance  in an evaluation study    learners  undergraduate students  completed a learning session on four biology topics with the attention aware components enabled  experimental group  or disabled  control group   the results indicated that gazetutor was successful in dynamically reorienting learners  attentional patterns towards the interface  importantly  learning gains for deep reasoning questions were significantly higher for the experimental vs  control group  but only for high aptitude learners  the results suggest that even the most basic attention aware technology can be effective in improving learning  at least for a subset of learners  however  a key limitation is that the researchers simply assumed that off screen gaze corresponded to inattention  but did not test this assumption  e g   students could have been concentrating with their eyes closed and this would have been perceived as being inattentive   attentivereview     is a closed loop system for mooc learning on mobile phones  the system uses video based photoplethysmography  ppg  to detect a learners  heart rate from the back camera of a smartphone while they view mooc like lectures on the phone  attentivereview ranks the lectures based    on its estimates of learners   perceived difficulty   selecting the most difficult lecture for subsequent review  called adaptive review   in a   participant between subjects evaluation study  the authors found that learning gains obtained from the adaptive review condition were statistically on par with a full review condition  but were achieved in      less review time  although this result suggests that attentivereview increased learning efficiency  there is the question as to whether the system should even be considered to be an  attention aware  technology  this is because it is arguable if the system has anything to do with attention  except for  attention  appearing in its name  as it selects items for review based on a model of  perceived difficulty  and not on learners   attentional state   the two might be related  but are clearly not the same       novelty our paper focuses on closing the loop between research on educational data and learning outcomes by developing and validating the first  in our view  real time learning technology that detects and mitigates mind wandering during computerized reading  although automated detection of complex mental states with the goal of developing intelligent learning technologies that respond to the sensed states is an active research area  see reviews by          mind wandering has rarely been explored as an aspect of a learner s mental state that warrants detection and corrective action  and while there has been some work on modeling the locus of learner attention  see review by       mind wandering is inherently different than more commonly studied forms of attention  e g   selective attention  distraction   because it involves more covert forms of involuntary attentional lapses spawned by self generated internal thought      simply put  mind wandering is a form of  looking without seeing  because the eyes might be fixated on the appropriate external stimulus  but very little is being processed as the mind is consumed by stimulusindependent internal thoughts  offline automated approaches to detect mind wandering have been developed  e g                  but these detectors have not yet been used to trigger online interventions  here  we adapt an offline gaze based automated mind wandering detector     to trigger real time interventions to address mind wandering during reading  we conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of our attentionaware learning technology in improving learning      mind wandering detection we adopted a supervised learning approach for mind wandering detection  below we provide a high level overview of the approach  readers are directed to        for a detailed discussion of the general approach used to build gaze based detectors of mind wandering       training data we obtained training data from a previous study     that involved   undergraduate students reading a   page text on the surface tension of liquids     on a computer screen for an average of   minutes  the text contained around   words  with an average of   words per page  and was displayed on a computer screen with courier new typeface  we recorded

      "participants could read normally and were free to move or gesture as they pleased  participants were instructed to report mind wandering  during reading  by pressing a predetermined key when they found themselves  thinking about the task itself but not the actual content of the text  or when they were  thinking about anything else besides the task   this is consistent with contemporary approaches  see      that rely on self reporting because mind wandering is an internal conscious phenomena  further  selfreports of mind wandering have been linked to predictable patterns in

produce a series of fixations  saccades  and blinks  from which global eye gaze features were extracted  see figure     global features are independent of the words being read and are therefore more generalizable than so called local features  a full list of   global features along with detailed descriptions is provided in      but briefly the features can be grouped into the following four

and absolute saccade angle distributions      pupil diameter descriptive features were statistical functionals  n      computed from participant level z score standardized estimates of pupil diameter      blink features  n      consisted of the number of blinks and the mean blink duration      miscellaneous gaze features  n      consisted of the number of saccades  horizontal saccade proportion  fixation dispersion  and the fixation duration saccade duration ratio  we proceeded with a subset of   features after eliminating features exhibiting multicollinearity  features were calculated from only a certain amount of gaze data from each page  called the window  the end of the window was positioned   seconds before a self report so as to not overlap with the key press  the average amount of time between self reports and the beginning of the page was   seconds  we used this time point as the end of the window for pages with no self report  pages that were shorter than the target window size were discarded  as were pages with windows that contained fewer than five gaze fixations as there was insufficient data to compute some of the features  there were a total of     windows with sufficient data for supervised classification  we experimented with a number of supervised classifiers on window sizes of       and   seconds to discriminate positive  pages with a self report

validation approach was adopted where models were built on data from n   participants and evaluated on the held out participant  the process was repeated for all participants  model validation was conducted in a way to simulate a real time system by analyzing data from every page  when classification was not possible due to a lack of valid gaze data and or because participants did not spend

involves creating and maintaining an internal model  mental model  by integrating information from the text with prior knowledge from memory      this integration process relies on attentional focus and breaks down during mind wandering because information from the external environment is no longer being integrated into the internal mental model  this results in an impaired model which leads to less effective suppression of off task thoughts  this increase in mind wandering further impairs the mental model    \f",
      "resulting in a vicious cycle  our intervention targets this vicious cycle by redirecting attention to the primary task and attempting to correct for comprehension deficits attributed to mind wandering  based on research demonstrating the effectiveness of interpolated testing      we propose that asking questions on pages where mind wandering is detected and encouraging rereading in response to incorrect responses will aid in re directing attention to the text and correct knowledge deficits   page regardless of whether the second question was answered correctly  so as not to be overly burdensome       intervention implementation our initial intervention was implemented for the same text used to create the mind wandering detector  although it could be applied to any text   the text was integrated into the computer reading interface  mind wandering detection occurred when the learner navigated to the next page using the right arrow key  in order to address ambiguity in mind wandering detection  we used the detector s mind wandering likelihood to probabilistically determine when to intervene  for example  if the mind wandering likelihood was     then there was a    chance of intervention on any given page  all else being equal   we did not intervene for the first three pages in order to allow the learner to become familiar with the text and interface  to reduce disruption  there was a    reduced probability of intervening on adjacent pages  and the maximum number of interventions was capped at     × the number of pages    for the present   page text   table

intervention strategy  the intervention itself relied on two multiple choice questions for each page  screen  of the text  when the system decided to intervene  one of the questions  randomly selected  was presented to the learner  if the learner answered this online question correctly  positive feedback was provided  and the learner could advance to the next page  if the learner answered incorrectly  negative feedback was provided  and the system encouraged the learner to re read the page  the learner was then provided with a second  randomly selected  online question  which could either be the same or the alternate question for that page  feedback was not provided and the learner was allowed to advance to the next  figure    outline of intervention strategy      iterative refinement the technology was refined through multiple rounds of formative testing with   participants  recruited from the same institution used to build the detector  participants were observed while interacting with the technology  their responses were analyzed  and they were interviewed about their experience  we used the feedback gleaned from these tests to refine the intervention parameters  i e   when to launch  how many interventions to launch  whether to launch interventions on subsequent pages   intervention questions themselves  and instructions on how to attend to the intervention  for example  earlier versions of the intervention used a fixed threshold  instead of the aforementioned probabilistic approach  to trigger an intervention  despite many attempts to set this threshold  the end result was that some participants received many interventions while others received almost no interventions  this issue was corrected by probabilistically rather than deterministically launching the intervention  additional testing refinement of the comprehension questions used in the intervention was done using crowdsourcing platforms  specifically amazon s mechanical turk  mturk       evaluation study we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the technology  the experiment had two conditions  an intervention condition and a yoked control condition  as described below   the yoked control was needed to verify that any learning benefits are attributed to the technology being sensitive to mind wandering and not merely to the added opportunities to answer online questions and re read  this is because we know that interpolated testing itself has beneficial comprehension effects           method participants  n      were a new set of undergraduate students who participated to fulfill research credit requirements  they were recruited from the same university used to build the mw detector and for the iterative testing and refinement cycles  we did not use a pretest because we expected participants to be unfamiliar with the topic  participants were not informed that the interface would be tracking their mind wandering  until the   \f",
      "debriefing at the end   instead  they were instructed as follows   while reading the text  you will occasionally be asked some questions about the page you just read  depending on your answer  you will re read the same page and you will be asked another question that may or may not be the same question   participants in the intervention condition received the intervention as described above  i e   based on detected mind wandering likelihoods   each participant in the yoked control condition was paired with a participant in the intervention condition  he or she received an intervention question on the same pages as their paired intervention participant regardless of mind wandering likelihood  for example  if participant a  i e   intervention condition  received questions on pages          and    participant b  i e   yoked control condition  would receive intervention questions on the same pages  however  if the yoked participant answered incorrectly  then  s he had the opportunity to re read and answer another question regardless of the outcome of their intervention condition partner  after reading  participants completed a   item multiple choice comprehension assessment to measure learning  the questions were randomly selected from the   pages  one per page  with the exception that a higher selection priority was given to pages that were re read on account of the intervention  participants in the yoked control condition received the same posttest questions as their intervention condition counterparts       results participants received an average of    min of   and max of    interventions  they spent an average of     seconds on each screen prior to receiving an intervention  there was no significant difference across conditions  p        suggesting that reading time was not a confound  in what follows  we compared each intervention participant to his her yoked control with a two tailed paired samples t test and a     criteria for statistical significance  mind wandering detection  the detector s likelihood of mind wandering was slightly higher for participants in the yokedcontrol condition  m       sd       compared to the intervention condition  m       sd        but the difference was not statistically significant  p        this was unsurprising as participants in both groups received the same interventions  which itself was expected to reduce mind wandering  importantly  mind wandering likelihoods were negatively correlated with performance on the online questions  r        p       as well as on posttest questions  r        p        this provides evidence for the validity of the mind wandering detector when applied to a new set of learners and under different conditions  i e   reading interspersed with online questions compared to uninterrupted reading   comprehension assessment  there was some overlap between the online questions and the posttest questions  to obtain an unbiased estimate of learning  we only analyzed performance on previously unseen posttest questions  that is  questions that were used as part of the intervention were first removed before computing posttest scores  there were no significant condition differences on overall posttest scores  p        the intervention condition answered       sd       of the questions correctly while the yoked control condition answered       sd       correctly  this finding was not surprising as both conditions received the exact same treatment except that the interventions were triggered based  on detected mind wandering in the intervention condition but not the control condition  next  we examined posttest performance as a function of mind wandering during reading  each page was designated as a low or high mind wandering page based on a median split of mind wandering likelihoods  medians      and    on a   to   scale for intervention and control conditions  respectively   we then analyzed performance on posttest questions corresponding to pages with low vs  high likelihoods of mind wandering  during reading   the results are shown in table    we found no significant posttest differences on pages where both the intervention and control participants had low  p       or high  p       mind wandering likelihoods  first and last rows in table    respectively   there was also no significant posttest difference  p       for pages where the intervention condition had high mind wandering likelihoods but the control condition had low mind wandering likelihoods  row     however  the intervention condition significantly  p       d      sigma  outperformed the control condition for pages where the intervention participants had low likelihoods of mind wandering but control participants had high mind wandering likelihoods  row     these last two finding suggests that the intervention had the intended effect of reducing comprehension deficits attributable to mind wandering because it led to

differs slightly across analyses as not all participants were assigned to each mind wandering group   after task interview  we interviewed a subset of the participants in order to gauge their subjective experience with the intervention  a few key themes emerged  participants reported paying closer attention to the text after realizing they would be periodically answering multiple choice questions  this was good  however  participants also reported that they adapted their reading strategies in one of two ways in response to the questions  since the questions targeted factual information  sometimes verbatim  from the text  some participants paid more attention to details and precise wordings instead of the broader concepts being discussed in the text  more discouragingly  some participants reported adopting a preemptive skimming strategy in that they would only look for keywords that they expected to appear in a subsequent question  participants were encouraged to re read text when they answered incorrectly before receiving another question  or the same question in some cases   many participants reported simply scanning the text  when re reading  to locate keywords from the question before moving on  since the scanning strategy was often   \f",
      "successful to answer the subsequent question  participants reported that the questions were too easy and it took relatively little effort to locate the correct answer compared to re reading  they suggested that it may have been better if the questions had targeted key concepts rather than facts  finally  participants reported difficulties with re engaging with the text after answering an online question because the text was cleared when an intervention question was displayed  an item that can be easily corrected in subsequent versions      discussion we developed the first educational technology capable of realtime mind wandering detection and dynamic intervention during computerized reading  in the remainder of this section  we discuss the significance of our main findings  limitations  and avenues for future work       significance of main findings we have three main findings  first  we demonstrated that a machine learned mind wandering detector built in one context can be applied to a different  albeit related  interaction context  specifically  the detector was trained on a data set involving participants silently reading and self reporting mind wandering  but was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated assessments  which engendered different reading strategies  further  self reports of mind wandering were not collected in this interactive context  which might have influenced mind wandering rates in and of itself  despite these differences  we were able to demonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing that it negatively correlated with both online and offline comprehension scores when evaluated on new participants  second  we showed promising effects for our intervention approach despite a very conservative experimental design  which ensured that the intervention and control groups were equated along all respects  except that the intervention was triggered based on the mind wandering detector  key manipulation   further  we used a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention  because the detector is inherently imperfect  as a result  participants could have received an intervention when they were not mind wandering and or could have failed to receive one when they were mind wandering  therefore  it was essential to compare the two groups under conditions when the mind wandering levels differed  this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the intervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension  because it is remedial   it equated comprehension scores when mind wandering was high  i e   scores for the intervention group were comparable when the control group was low on mind wandering   it also demonstrated the cost of not intervening during mind wandering  i e   scores for the intervention group were greater when the control group was high on mind wandering   in other words  the intervention was successful in mitigating the negative effects of mind wandering  third  despite the advantages articulated above  the intervention itself was reactive and engendered several unintended  and presumably suboptimal  behaviors  in particular  students altered their reading strategies in response to the interpolated questions  which were a critical part of the intervention  in a sense  they attempted to  game the intervention  by attempting to proactively predict the types of questions they might receive and then adopting a complementary reading strategy consisting of skimming and or focusing on factual information  this reliance on surface  rather than deeper levels of processing was incongruent with our goal of promoting deep comprehension       limitations there are a number of methodological limitations with this work that go beyond limitations with the intervention  as discussed above   first  we focused on a single text that is perceived as being quite dull and consequently triggers rather high levels of mind wandering      this raises the question of whether the detector will generalize to different texts  we expect some level of generalizability in terms of features used because the detector only used content  and position   on the screen  free global gaze features  however  given that several supervised classifiers are very sensitive to differences in base rates  the detector might overor under  predict mind wandering when applied to texts that engender different rates of mind wandering  therefore  retraining the detector with a more diverse set of texts is warranted  another limitation is the scalability of our learning technology  the eye tracker we used was a cost prohibitive tobii tx  that will not scale beyond the laboratory  fortunately  commercialoff the shelf  cots  eye trackers  such as eye tribe and tobii eyex  can be used to surpass this limitation  it is an open question as to whether the mind wandering detector can operate with similar fidelity with these cots eye trackers  our use of global gaze features which do not require high precision eye tracking holds considerable promise in this regard  nevertheless  replication with scalable eye trackers and or scalable alternatives to eye tracking  e g   facial feature tracking     or monitoring reading patterns      is an important next step  see section       our use of surface level questions for both the intervention and the subsequent comprehension assessment is also a limitation as is the lack of a delayed comprehension assessment  it might be the case that the intervention effects manifest as richer encodings in long term memory  a possibility that cannot be addressed in the current experiment that only assessed immediate learning  other limitations include a limited student sample  i e  undergraduates from a private midwestern college  and a laboratory setup  it is possible that the results would not generalize to a more diverse student population or in more ecological environments  but see below for evidence of generalizability of the detector in classroom environments   replication with data from more diverse populations and environments would be a necessary next step to increase the ecological validity of this work       future work our future work is progressing along two main fronts  one is to address limitations in the intervention and design of the experimental evaluation as discussed above  accordingly  we are exploring alternative intervention strategies  such as   a  tagging items for future re study rather than interrupting participants during reading   b  highlighting specific portions of the text as an overt cue to facilitate comprehension of critical information   c  asking fewer intervention questions  but selecting inference questions that target deeper levels of comprehension and that span multiple pages of the text  and  d  asking learners to engage in reflection by providing written self explanations of the textual content  we are currently evaluating one such redesigned intervention – open ended questions targeting deeper levels of comprehension  item c   our revised experimental design taps both surface  and inference level comprehension and assesses comprehension immediately after reading  to measure learning  and after a one week delay  to measure retention   we are also developing attention aware versions of more interactive interfaces  such as learning with an intelligent tutoring   \f",
      "system called gurututor      this project also addresses some of the scalability concerns by replacing expensive research grade eye tracking with cost effective cots eye tracking  e g   the eye tribe or tobii eyex  and provides evidence for real world generalizability by collecting data in classrooms rather than the lab  we recently tested our implementation on   students  total  in a noisy computer enabled high school classroom where eyegaze of entire classes of students was collected during their normal class periods      using a similar approach to the present work  we used the data to build and validate a studentindependent gaze based mind wandering detector  the resultant mind wandering detection accuracy  f  of      was substantially greater than chance  f  of      and outperformed earlier work on the same domain      the next step is to develop interventions that redirect attention and correct learning deficiencies attributable to mind wandering and to test the interventions in real world environments  by doing so  we hope to advance our foundational vision of developing next generation technologies that enhance the process and products of learning by  attending to attention                                      figure    guru tutor interface overlaid with eye gaze obtained via the eyetribe          acknowledgements this research was supported by the national science foundation  nsf   drl   and iis     the authors are grateful to kris kopp and jenny wu for their contributions to the study  any opinions  findings and conclusions  or recommendations expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of nsf                \n"
